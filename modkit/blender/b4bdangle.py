"""Secondary motion for survivor models fitted by b4bfit.py (3P): long hair that swings and skirts that sway.

The game gives heroes two kinds of it, and a custom mesh can use both without new blueprints:
  1. Hair on the survivor's physics bones. Some survivors have a ponytail/braid chain under `head` (Holly, Holly
     Elite 06, Walker Elite 03, Doc Elite 03: hair_00..02; Mom: hair_00_l/r..hair_02_l/r) whose bodies are
     PhysType_Simulated in the survivor's physics asset; the hero anim blueprint's RigidBody node simulates them.
     `rig_hair` skins the model's back hair to that chain (by height below its root, behind the head). `pin_hair`
     (every survivor) then gives long hair lying on the body a share of the torso under it, as much as its clearance
     needs, so it no longer sweeps through the back, bottom and legs with the head or the chain.
  2. Cloth. Skirts, dresses, coat tails and capes become cloth sections: `cloth_regions` separates their faces into
     objects the importer turns into their own sections, and builds a low-poly simulation mesh for each garment: a
     closed tube for skirts and closed coats, an open panel (around the back, the front left open) for open-front
     coats and capes; its top row is fixed (the waist, or the hips for a cape). modkit/cloth.py writes it
     into a clothing asset of the outfit (adding one if the outfit has none) and maps the render vertices onto it.
How it works: docs/investigations/mesh-mods.md §14 (b4b-coop repository).
