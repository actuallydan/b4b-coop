; b4bcoop settings. Everything here is optional: with no changes you host automatically in offline Fort Hope,
; and your Steam friends join you with "Join Game" in their Steam friends list.

b4bcoop $version (protocol $protocol) - private Back 4 Blood co-op in offline mode, with your Steam friends.
No Warner Bros / Turtle Rock servers. Everyone who plays together needs the mod, and the same version.

INSTALL (Windows, Linux and Steam Deck - the same steps)
1. Open the game folder: in Steam, right-click Back 4 Blood > Manage > Browse local files.
   It is the folder with Back4Blood.exe and a folder named Gobi in it. On Steam Deck, use Desktop Mode.
2. Extract EVERYTHING from this zip into that folder. The zip's Gobi folder merges into the game's
   Gobi folder (say yes if asked to merge). No game file is replaced. You get:
     xinput1_3.dll                          next to Back4Blood.exe
     b4bcoop-README.txt, b4bcoop-COMMANDS.txt, b4bcoop-LICENSE.txt
     Gobi\Binaries\Win64\X3DAudio1_7.dll    the mod
     Gobi\Binaries\Win64\b4bcoop.ini        settings (optional)
3. That's all: no launch options, no scripts.

PLAY
1. Press Play in Steam. Steam itself must be online: joins go through Steam.
2. At the title screen, sign in and choose Offline.
3. In Fort Hope you are hosting automatically: your Steam friends see "Join Game" on you in their
   Steam friends list. Nothing to set up, no ports to open.
4. Start missions from the war table as usual. Everyone in your game follows you in.
JOIN A FRIEND: in the Steam friends list, right-click your friend while they are in Back 4 Blood >
Join Game, or accept their Steam invite. Works with your game closed or running.
Only the host's Steam friends can join. Type /help in the game's chat for the chat commands.
All chat commands and options, with examples: b4bcoop-COMMANDS.txt (next to this file).

OPTIONS (all optional): open Gobi\Binaries\Win64\b4bcoop.ini in a text editor, remove the ';' in front of a line.
  host=0             don't host; your offline game stays private
  teamsize=5         (host) 5 survivors instead of 4
  flashlight_key=L   the flashlight toggle key (off turns it off)
  allow_joins=anyone (host) also let in people who aren't your Steam friends;
                     or allow_steamids=<17-digit Steam ID> for one person
  host_ip=1          ADVANCED: host and join by IP address instead of through Steam. Needs port
                     forwarding (UDP 7777) and triggers the Windows Firewall prompt.
  More options and details: b4bcoop-COMMANDS.txt.

ADD-ONS (textures, models): put the add-on's .pak in a b4bcoop-addons folder next to Back4Blood.exe and
restart the game; /addons lists them. Only you see your add-ons. Hosts let in players with cosmetic add-ons
only, by default (addons_policy=). Details: b4bcoop-COMMANDS.txt, "Add-ons".

REMOVE: delete these files from the game folder.
1. Next to Back4Blood.exe: xinput1_3.dll, b4bcoop-README.txt, b4bcoop-COMMANDS.txt, b4bcoop-LICENSE.txt, and
   the b4bcoop-addons folder (only there if you installed add-ons).
2. In Gobi\Binaries\Win64: X3DAudio1_7.dll, b4bcoop.ini, all b4bcoop-*.log files, and b4bcoop-bans.txt
   (only there if you banned someone).
3. Left over from older versions, if present, in Gobi\Binaries\Win64: dwmapi.dll, "Play B4B co-op.cmd",
   steam_appid.txt. On Linux also remove the launch option WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dwmapi=n,b" %command%
Steam's "Verify integrity of game files" does NOT remove these: they are extra files, not game files.
Your offline progress stays either way.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- "Everyone needs the same version": someone has another b4bcoop version. Everyone downloads the
  latest release and extracts it again.
- Play online / with Easy Anti-Cheat without removing the mod: add  -b4bcoop=off  to the launch options
  (Steam > right-click Back 4 Blood > Properties > Launch Options). Remove it again to play co-op.
- The log: Gobi\Binaries\Win64\b4bcoop-<number>.log (the newest one). Its first lines show the version.
  No new log after starting the game = the mod didn't load.
- Windows: this install layout hasn't been tested on a Windows PC yet (it has on Linux / Proton). If the
  mod doesn't load there, please open an issue on GitHub and attach Gobi\Binaries\Win64\b4bcoop-launcher.log
  if that file exists.
- Join Game missing or not working: both need the mod (same version), Steam online, and the host in
  Fort Hope or a mission. Fallback: the host looks up their 17-digit Steam ID (Steam > click your account
  name at the top right > Account details), and you type  /join steam:<that number>  in the game's chat.

SAFETY
Unofficial, not affiliated with Turtle Rock Studios or Warner Bros. Games. Offline mode only: it blocks the game's
online services while it runs. Don't use it for online play. By default nothing is opened to the network: players
connect through Steam. No warranty (see b4bcoop-LICENSE.txt).
