# Cheats (host sandbox)

An opt-in sandbox for the **host**: god mode, flying, spawning ridden, forcing a horde, and so on. Everything is a chat
command (type it in the game's chat box; a message starting with `/` is never sent to the other players).

**The rules:**
- **Off until the host turns them on** with `/cheats on`. `/cheats off` turns them off again, and they switch off by
  themselves when the game goes back to Fort Hope (camp) or the menus. Moving on to the next chapter keeps them on.
- **Host only.** Every cheat command works only on the host (the player whose game the others joined, or your own
  offline game). Typed by someone who joined, it only replies `host only` and does nothing.
- **Everyone is told.** Turning cheats on or off, and every cheat that affects another player or the whole game, shows
  a `[b4bcoop] host ...` line in everyone's chat (for example `[b4bcoop] host gave god mode to Mellon`).
- **Nobody else's save is touched.** Cheats change the running game, or the host's own save (`/supply`, `/unlockall`).
  From the moment cheats are turned on, the rest of that map gives the other players **no supply points, skull
  totem points, unlocks, stats or achievements** (the host keeps its own). Their own burn cards are still charged as
  usual. The chat says so when cheats are turned on.
- Cheats that change a hero (god, fly, infinite ammo, speed, freeze) last until the map changes; `/cheats off` undoes
  them.

**Naming a player:** `[player]` is a name from `/players`, its number (`#2`), `me` (the host, the default when left
out) or `all` (every hero, players and bots). All copies of the game on one Steam account share a name; use the
number then.

## Turning cheats on and off

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/cheats on` | Turns cheats on for this game. Everyone sees `host enabled cheats`. | `/cheats on` |
| `/cheats off` | Turns them off and undoes god mode, infinite ammo, game speed, freeze, size and the free camera. | `/cheats off` |
| `/cheats` or `/cheats help` | Lists the cheat commands and what is on right now. | `/cheats` |

## Survival

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/god [player\|all] [on\|off]` | God mode: no damage and no death. Without `on`/`off` it toggles (`all` turns it on for everyone). Follows the player onto a new hero (a rescue, a bot take-over) until the map changes. | `/god all`, `/god Mellon off` |
| `/heal [player\|all]` | Full health, trauma included (the lost part of the health bar). Downed heroes need `/revive`. | `/heal all` |
| `/revive [player\|all]` | Gets downed (incapacitated) heroes back up with half their health. Default: everyone. Dead heroes still come back through the rescue closets as usual. | `/revive` |
| `/ammo infinite\|off` | Infinite reserve ammo on every weapon, for everyone (weapons picked up later too). You still reload. | `/ammo infinite` |
| `/copper <+N\|-N> [player\|all]` | Gives (or takes) copper. Default: every hero. Up to 100000 at once. | `/copper +500`, `/copper -100 #2` |
| `/card <card name> [player\|all]` | Adds a gameplay card to a hero's active cards during a mission, as if drawn: it stays for the rest of the run. Name as shown in the game (`amped up`) or its internal row name; spaces and case don't matter. | `/card amped up`, `/card steady aim all` |
| `/card list [filter]` | Lists card names matching the filter (up to 40). | `/card list aim` |

## Movement and camera

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/fly [player\|all]` | Fly mode (move freely up and down with the camera). Players only, not bots. | `/fly`, `/fly #2` |
| `/noclip` | Fly through walls. Your own hero only: another player's game would still stop them at walls. | `/noclip` |
| `/walk [player\|all]` | Back to normal (ends fly and noclip). | `/walk all` |
| `/tp <player\|saferoom\|start>` | Teleports you to a player, to this map's end saferoom, or back to its start saferoom. Entering the end saferoom with the whole team can end the chapter, as walking in would. | `/tp saferoom`, `/tp Mellon` |
| `/tp <player\|all> <player\|me\|saferoom\|start>` | Teleports a player (or everyone) somewhere; each gets their own spot. | `/tp all me`, `/tp #2 start` |
| `/freecam` | A free-flying camera for your own view only; your hero stays where it is. **Press F8 to come back** (the chat doesn't work while it's on). | `/freecam` |
| `/size <0.25-4>` | Your own hero's size (1 = normal). Only you see it. | `/size 2` |

## World and director

These act on the whole mission (only during a mission).

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/horde` | Triggers a horde now. | `/horde` |
| `/director calm\|build\|peak\|fade\|recover` | Forces the AI director's pacing phase: calm (no pressure), build (build-up), peak, peak fade, recover. | `/director peak` |
| `/spawn <type> [1-10]` | Spawns ridden in front of you. Types: `tallboy crusher bruiser reeker exploder retch stinger stalker hocker hag snitcher breaker ogre common`. | `/spawn crusher 2` |
| `/killall` | Kills every ridden in the map (common ridden, specials, mutations). Never players, bots or allies. | `/killall` |
| `/freeze` | Freezes the world except the players (ridden and bots stop). Again to resume. | `/freeze` |
| `/slomo <0.1-5>` | Game speed for everyone (1 = normal). | `/slomo 0.5` |
| `/win` | Ends the mission as a success (the normal end-of-mission flow). | `/win` |
| `/lose` | Ends the mission as a failure (on most difficulties the mission restarts). | `/lose` |

## Your own progression (permanent)

These change **your own save, permanently**. They never touch another player's save.

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/supply <+N>` | Adds supply points to your save (1-100000). | `/supply +1000` |
| `/unlockall` | Unlocks every item in the supply lines you don't have yet (not burn cards, which are consumables, and not DLC items). `/unlockall check` only counts them. | `/unlockall check`, `/unlockall` |

## Not included, and why

- **Game's own developer cheats**: `God`, `GiveUnlock`, `GiveSupplyPoints`, `Heal` and the other built-in cheat
  commands are empty in the released game, and it never gives a player the engine's cheat manager. The commands above
  are rebuilt from the game's own functions instead.
- **Noclip and size for other players**: collision and size aren't shared over the network, so their own game would
  keep stopping them at walls or at their normal size. Fly works for them.
- **Reviving dead heroes**: dead heroes are rescued from the rescue closets as usual; `/revive` gets downed heroes up.
- **Spawning bosses** (the Abomination, sleepers): they are scripted into their maps and don't work spawned anywhere.
